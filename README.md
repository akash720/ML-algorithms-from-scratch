# ML-algorithms-from-scratch ![](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=akash720.ML-algo-from-scratch.readme)
This repository contains implementation of some basic Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch. The language used is Python and data used is from Stanford ML course. 

Following is the list of algorithms covered so far:
1. [Linear Regression with single and multiple variables](Linear_Regression.ipynb)
2. [Logistic Regression](Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
3. [Regularized Linear Regression with single and multiple variables](Regularized_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
